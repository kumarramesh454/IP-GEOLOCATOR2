#IP-GEOLOCATOR

An IP Geolocator is a software tool or web service
that enables the user to determine the
geographical location of a given IP address.
The IP Geolocator works by using a database of IP
addresses and their corresponding geographic
locations, or by querying third-party geolocation
APIs to obtain location information.
